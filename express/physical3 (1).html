<h1>12 Best Ways to Protect Yourself from COVID-19 Coronavirus Infection</h1><br>
<h2>1.Maintain Your Distance  </h2>

<br>It is difficult to identify who is infected and who isn’t, so avoid close contact with people around you. If someone around you is coughing or sneezing, try to maintain a distance of 1 meter and cover your mouth and eyes.<br> Since the disease spreads from person to person through the liquid droplets that are sprayed when someone sneezes or coughs, doing this can prevent the virus from entering your body. <br>
<h2>2.Seek Medical Care Early</h2>

<br>If you or someone you know is showing symptoms like cough, fever, or difficulty breathing, visit a doctor as soon as possible. If you are a senior with a history of pneumonia or have symptoms of pneumonia, you need to be on the watch and report to your doctor for necessary tests. <br>By doing so, you will protect yourself and also help prevent the spread of the virus. <br>
<h2>3.Stay Informed and Updated  </h2>

<h2>4.Practice Food Safety </h2>

<br>Have separate cutting boards for meat and vegetables and clean them regularly with soap. Wash your hands after handling raw food and before consuming cooked food. Do not eat food from restaurants or stalls that don't have basic hygiene facilities like hand wash or sanitizer. <br>Only consume meat products that have been thoroughly cooked because the heat kills the germs that may be present. <br>
<h2>5. Travel with Caution  </h2>

Wear face masks in crowded regions, don't touch your mask with your hands once you've put it on. <br>
