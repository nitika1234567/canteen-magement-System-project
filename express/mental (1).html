The Coronavirus pandemic has made people conscious about innumerable factors which they misheeded in their normal lives before this virus showed up.<br> People have always been engaged with their work, be it their jobs, studies, marriage and what not! This virus has made us aware of numerous things which we would have known earlier.

<br>We ignore our health and mental well being because we are so busy and occupied by the workload. Stress, depression, anxiety, deadlines, etc. has always kept us clocked up without us realising what we actually have gained. For a chunk of money we encumber and situate ourselves in a precarious and in the worst condition. <br>Often there is no coming back from such a condition and not just this we are compromising our precious lives as well.

<br>As we all know there is no vaccine for this virus and scientists are monotonously working on it. We are well aware of the fact that immunity is the most necessary thing which can save our lives until the time vaccine isn’t ready. <br>But we have situated ourselves into a condition where all we know is that we were busy making money which is now of no use to cure us. There is a shortage of beds and ventilators in hospitals. Private hospitals are not affordable for everyone. Government hospitals are completely occupied and now there are not many options left for us.

<br>But is it all? Is this the only reason for people dying. We hear in news about the rapidly increasing death rate in our country due to the virus. But do you know there are people dying because of stress and depression? Our preoccupied lives never gave us time to think about our own selves. We always made a work schedule but we never took the time to think about our mental health. Yes! it is rightly said that money can’t buy happiness.<br> Imagine being a millionaire but also being in a situation where your mental health is not good. You don’t feel like being happy, you don’t want to talk to anyone, don’t want to go out, don’t want to eat. All you do is cry and overthink about petty issues. Well, that is depression and it leads you to an end.

<br>Some mistakes we all made in our lives are mentioned below. Now we will realise what we did in the past that is affecting our present and may also affect our future.<br>

<br><h2>1) STRESS AND DEPRESSION:</h2>  The most common reason nowadays is stressful lives and people being in depression. Well, what causes stress? There are many factors that cause us overthinking and worrying on a particular thing and that leads us into stressful situations where we also suffer from a number of health issues. Such stressful situations often depress us where we start losing all the hopes and also our positivity shrinks away. With time the situation worsens and it brings us to an end where we start thinking about impractical solutions for our problems. <br>These can be suicide, robbery, murders, hurting people etc. Now, there are many factors that lead to such a situation. Stress can be due to work, career, family and relationship. Working for long hours and the pressure of submitting the work before deadlines and thus not being able to bring a balance in life leads us to annoying situations. We think our career is at risk and that we won’t be able to accomplish our goal. Such a situation would be irksome and may infuriate us where we often burst out on our family and this can thus affect our relationships too. <br> Well, all these are interconnected and if one isn’t going well, others get affected too. These four factors play an important role in a person’s life and it is in our control how we can manage these altogether.

<br>Starting from the basic, we can always manage our work and remember that even if something is not done on time there is always a way out and a better option to deal with that situation. Nothing can put an end to your career until and unless you are at the beck and call to give up! One must always remember that family and relationship plays a very important role in one’s life. Sharing problems with our close friends can really help us to find the best solution to it.<br>

<br><h2>2) MONEY:</h2> They say “Money can’t buy happiness.” I totally agree with this. We can definitely satisfy our needs with money. We can live a lavish life only if we have money. But is it all? Imagine staying alone and being rich but having no one to share your emotions with. No one can survive alone. We all need someone to complete us be it our family, friends or life partner. And money can never buy us a person with whom we can be happy forever. So we all must keep in mind that our life’s happiness is our real wealth.<br>

<br><h2>3) HEALTH:</h2>  In the race of becoming successful we often compromise our health. Not taking meals on time and even skipping them is the most common mistake we all make. Not exercising is another. We are not doing justice with our body. We continuously work at a stretch and for long hours but we forget that our bodies need to relax too. We need weekends to party and take a break from work but do we ever think about our body and mind. Humans are not machines and they cannot achieve everything all at once. So how can you assure that your body can gear up on its own?<br>

<br>You must always remember that if you are healthy only then you can achieve your goal and become successful.<br>

<br>Consider beauty in everything. Be sanguine about things. Everything takes time. In the end, you will get what you deserve and you will be happy. Amidst this pandemic, all we can do is stay positive and work on our mental health.
